This AI was originally set up to identify photos of bananas, oranges and lemons and it is currently set up for them.
In order to work few folders should be created.
oryginal_photos where in subfolders with according names (example: Banana for folder containing bananas photos) should be put 10 photos od desired object numbered from 1 to 10.
test folder where photos of object to identify after the model is trained should be put.
Also current code may require Nvidia GPU with CUDA libraries installed, but model training on CPU is possible (for more information refer to Tensorflow Forums).
